## My Design Process

A friend of mine told me she was working on a weather app so I thought that I would give it a try too. I chose the name 'meteor' because of its high-impact name and relation to the skies.

### Color Palette and Shapes
The color is blue because of its relation to water / rain. However, some of the other elements will have the option of changing color depending on the temperature (Future update).
